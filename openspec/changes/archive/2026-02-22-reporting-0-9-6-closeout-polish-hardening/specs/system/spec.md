## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Reporting Endpoints SHALL Provide Aggregated Read Models
The system SHALL provide aggregated report read models with release-ready reliability characteristics, including export compatibility, responsive web usability, and regression-safe behavior in reporting flows.

#### Scenario: Monthly summary returns summary DTO
Given valid date query inputs  
When the client calls `GET /api/v1/reports/monthly-summary`  
Then the API returns `200 OK`  
And the response is `MonthlySummaryDto { From, To, IncomeTotal, ExpenseTotal, Net, TransactionsCount }`

#### Scenario: Account-group totals may return not found
Given a group id that does not exist  
When the client calls `GET /api/v1/reports/account-groups/{groupId}/totals`  
Then the API returns `404 NotFound`  
And mapped not-found errors use `{ error }`

#### Scenario: Asset total balance report returns as-of aggregated asset balance
Given a valid as-of date and authorized user  
When the client calls `GET /api/v1/reports/asset-total-balance?asOf=YYYY-MM-DD`  
Then the API returns `200 OK`  
And the response contains `AsOf`, `TotalCents`, and `AssetAccountsCount`

#### Scenario: Monthly evolution report returns scoped monthly series
Given a valid `year` and `scope` and an authorized user  
When the client calls `GET /api/v1/reports/monthly-evolution?year=YYYY&scope=<scope>`  
Then the API returns `200 OK`  
And the response contains ordered monthly points with `EndBalanceCents`, `DeltaVsPreviousMonthCents`, and `DeltaVsYearStartCents`

#### Scenario: Monthly evolution report rejects invalid query parameters
Given a request with missing or invalid `year` or `scope`  
When the client calls `GET /api/v1/reports/monthly-evolution`  
Then the API returns `400 BadRequest`

#### Scenario: Reporting flows remain export-compatible and regression-safe
Given final `0.9` reporting features are enabled  
When users execute supported report flows and export actions  
Then output values MUST remain consistent with report read models  
And release gates MUST block shipment on critical regression failures
